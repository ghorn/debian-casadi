Description: numerical optimization and algorithmic differentiation framework
 CasADi is a numerical optimization and algorithmic differentiation framework.
 It can be used from C++ or Python.
 .
 It provides users with a set of building blocks that simplify the process of
 implementing efficient gradient-based solvers for numerical optimization
 problems in general, and simulation-based nonlinear programs (optimal control)
 in particular. This can be done with a range of different methods including
 direct collocation, direct multiple shooting and indirect methods.
 .
 CasADi is designed as a symbolic framework that allows construction of
 large computational graphs made up of matrix-valued operations, and a
 state-of-the-art framework for algorithmic differentiation (AD) - also known
 as automatic differentiation - that operates on these computational graphs.
 Also contained is a set of solvers and interfaces to third-party solvers for
 nonlinear programming (NLP), quadratic programming (QP) and initial-value
 problems in ordinary differential equations (ODE) or diffential-algebraic
 equations (DAE). Other features of interest include generation of
 self-contained C-code and symbolic import of models from the Modelica physical
 modeling language and the AMPL algebraic modeling language.
 .
 This package contains the core library.
